# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing retro insights generator by adding LLM-powered analysis capabilities. Currently, the system uses rule-based analysis to generate insights from GitHub, Linear, and Slack data. The LLM integration will provide more sophisticated, contextual, and nuanced insights by analyzing patterns, sentiment, and relationships in the collected data that rule-based systems might miss.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want the system to use AI to analyze our team data and generate deeper insights, so that I can get more meaningful and actionable retrospective feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system has collected data from GitHub, Linear, and Slack THEN the system SHALL send this data to an LLM for analysis
2. WHEN the LLM processes the team data THEN the system SHALL receive structured insights in the same format as current rule-based insights (wentWell, didntGoWell, actionItems)
3. WHEN LLM analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL merge LLM insights with existing rule-based insights
4. IF LLM analysis fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to rule-based insights only

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure which LLM provider to use for insights generation, so that I can choose the most appropriate AI service for my team's needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the application THEN the system SHALL support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
2. WHEN an LLM provider is selected THEN the system SHALL validate the API credentials before processing
3. WHEN LLM provider configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and fall back to rule-based analysis
4. IF no LLM provider is configured THEN the system SHALL continue to work with rule-based insights only

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team member, I want the AI insights to be clearly distinguished from rule-based insights, so that I can understand the source and reliability of different recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying insights THEN the system SHALL clearly label LLM-generated insights with an "AI" badge or indicator
2. WHEN showing insight details THEN the system SHALL indicate whether the insight came from rules or AI analysis
3. WHEN both rule-based and AI insights exist for similar topics THEN the system SHALL group them together but maintain source distinction
4. WHEN exporting retro results THEN the system SHALL include source attribution for each insight

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want the AI to provide more sophisticated analysis than simple keyword matching, so that I can get insights about team dynamics, code quality trends, and process improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing GitHub data THEN the LLM SHALL identify patterns in commit messages, PR descriptions, and code review comments beyond simple keyword matching
2. WHEN analyzing Linear data THEN the LLM SHALL understand relationships between issue types, completion patterns, and team velocity trends
3. WHEN analyzing Slack data THEN the LLM SHALL assess team communication patterns, collaboration quality, and sentiment trends
4. WHEN generating action items THEN the LLM SHALL provide specific, actionable recommendations based on identified patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the LLM integration to be performant and cost-effective, so that generating insights doesn't significantly slow down the retro process or incur excessive costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing team data THEN the system SHALL optimize LLM requests to minimize token usage while maintaining insight quality
2. WHEN LLM analysis takes longer than 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator to the user
3. WHEN LLM requests fail due to rate limits THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
4. IF LLM analysis exceeds a configurable timeout THEN the system SHALL cancel the request and fall back to rule-based insights

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a team member, I want the AI insights to respect our team's privacy and data security, so that sensitive information is not exposed or misused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending data to LLM providers THEN the system SHALL sanitize sensitive information (emails, API keys, personal identifiers)
2. WHEN processing Slack messages THEN the system SHALL exclude private channels unless explicitly configured
3. WHEN using external LLM services THEN the system SHALL provide clear warnings about data being sent to third parties
4. IF using local LLM models THEN the system SHALL provide this as a privacy-focused option
