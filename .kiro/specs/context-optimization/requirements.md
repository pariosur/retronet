# Context and Token Management Enhancement

## Problem Analysis

Based on the current codebase analysis, I've identified several critical issues with context and token management:

### Current Issues:
1. **Hardcoded Low Token Limits**: Default `maxTokens: 4000` even for models supporting 128K+ tokens
2. **No Model-Specific Token Limits**: GPT-5 supports 32K+ tokens but system treats it like GPT-3.5
3. **Inefficient Data Truncation**: Simple character-based truncation loses important context
4. **No RAG Implementation**: All data sent in single prompt, causing token overflow
5. **Poor Context Prioritization**: No intelligent selection of most relevant data

### Token Capacity Analysis:
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: 16K tokens (currently limited to 4K)
- **GPT-4**: 8K tokens (currently limited to 4K) 
- **GPT-4-turbo**: 128K tokens (currently limited to 4K)
- **GPT-5**: 32K+ tokens (currently limited to 4K)
- **Claude models**: 200K tokens (currently limited to 4K)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic Token Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to automatically use the full token capacity of each model, so that we can analyze larger datasets without losing important context.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a model is selected THEN the system SHALL automatically configure token limits based on the model's actual capacity
2. WHEN using GPT-4-turbo THEN the system SHALL utilize up to 120K tokens for input (leaving 8K for response)
3. WHEN using GPT-5 THEN the system SHALL utilize up to 28K tokens for input (leaving 4K for response)
4. WHEN using Claude models THEN the system SHALL utilize up to 180K tokens for input (leaving 20K for response)
5. IF model capacity is unknown THEN the system SHALL default to conservative 3K token limit

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Context Selection

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want the system to intelligently select the most relevant data when datasets are large, so that insights focus on the most impactful information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN data exceeds token limits THEN the system SHALL prioritize recent activity over older data
2. WHEN selecting GitHub data THEN the system SHALL prioritize PRs with reviews over simple commits
3. WHEN selecting Linear data THEN the system SHALL prioritize completed issues and blockers over routine tasks
4. WHEN selecting Slack data THEN the system SHALL prioritize messages with high engagement over routine notifications
5. WHEN truncating data THEN the system SHALL maintain representative samples from each data source

### Requirement 3: Progressive Analysis Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to break down large datasets into focused analysis chunks when needed, so that we get comprehensive insights without hitting token limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN data exceeds 80% of token capacity THEN the system SHALL offer progressive analysis option
2. WHEN using progressive analysis THEN the system SHALL analyze data in thematic chunks (technical, process, communication)
3. WHEN combining progressive results THEN the system SHALL merge insights intelligently without duplication
4. WHEN progressive analysis is used THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of the analysis approach
5. IF progressive analysis fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to intelligent truncation

### Requirement 4: Context-Aware Data Summarization

**User Story:** As a team member, I want the system to summarize less critical data rather than dropping it entirely, so that we don't lose important patterns in large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN data needs reduction THEN the system SHALL summarize rather than truncate where possible
2. WHEN summarizing commits THEN the system SHALL group by patterns and themes
3. WHEN summarizing issues THEN the system SHALL aggregate by type and status
4. WHEN summarizing messages THEN the system SHALL extract key topics and sentiment
5. WHEN providing summaries THEN the system SHALL indicate what data was summarized vs. analyzed in full

### Requirement 5: Smart Token Estimation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want accurate token counting that accounts for different model tokenization, so that we maximize data utilization without exceeding limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN estimating tokens THEN the system SHALL use model-specific tokenization patterns
2. WHEN using OpenAI models THEN the system SHALL account for GPT tokenizer characteristics
3. WHEN using Anthropic models THEN the system SHALL account for Claude tokenizer differences
4. WHEN calculating token usage THEN the system SHALL include system prompt, data, and response buffer
5. IF token estimation is uncertain THEN the system SHALL err on the side of caution with 10% buffer

### Requirement 6: Fallback and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to gracefully handle token limit issues and provide useful insights even when data is too large, so that analysis never completely fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN token limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL automatically apply the best available strategy
2. WHEN all optimization fails THEN the system SHALL provide analysis of available data subset
3. WHEN data is truncated THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate what was included vs. excluded
4. WHEN using fallback strategies THEN the system SHALL explain the approach taken
5. IF no data can fit THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on reducing dataset size

## Success Metrics

- **Token Utilization**: Achieve 80%+ of model capacity utilization
- **Data Coverage**: Maintain 90%+ of important data in analysis
- **Analysis Success Rate**: 95%+ successful insight generation
- **Performance**: Complete analysis within 60 seconds for typical datasets
- **User Satisfaction**: Clear feedback on data handling and optimization strategies

## Technical Approach Options

### Option 1: Enhanced Truncation (Immediate)
- Implement model-specific token limits
- Add intelligent data prioritization
- Improve truncation algorithms
- **Pros**: Quick to implement, works with existing architecture
- **Cons**: Still loses data, limited scalability

### Option 2: Progressive Analysis (Recommended)
- Break large datasets into thematic chunks
- Analyze each chunk separately
- Intelligently merge results
- **Pros**: Handles any dataset size, maintains quality
- **Cons**: More complex, longer processing time

### Option 3: RAG Implementation (Future)
- Implement vector database for team data
- Use semantic search for relevant context
- Generate insights from retrieved context
- **Pros**: Highly scalable, maintains all data
- **Cons**: Significant architecture change, requires vector DB

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach (Optimal)
- Use enhanced truncation for small datasets
- Use progressive analysis for medium datasets  
- Implement RAG for very large datasets
- **Pros**: Best of all approaches, handles any scenario
- **Cons**: Most complex to implement

## Recommendation

Start with **Option 2 (Progressive Analysis)** as it provides the best balance of:
- Immediate impact on current token limit issues
- Scalability for growing datasets
- Maintainable complexity
- Clear path to future RAG implementation

The progressive analysis approach will:
1. **Solve immediate problems**: Handle current token overflow issues
2. **Scale effectively**: Work with any dataset size
3. **Maintain quality**: Provide comprehensive analysis without data loss
4. **Enable future growth**: Create foundation for RAG implementation

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1 (Critical)**: Model-specific token limits and basic progressive analysis
2. **Phase 2 (High)**: Intelligent data prioritization and summarization
3. **Phase 3 (Medium)**: Advanced progressive analysis with smart merging
4. **Phase 4 (Future)**: RAG implementation for ultimate scalability
