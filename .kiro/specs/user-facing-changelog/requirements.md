# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a user-facing changelog generation capability to the existing retrospective tool. Unlike technical changelogs that focus on code changes, this feature will create customer-friendly changelogs that translate technical updates into business value and user impact. The changelog will leverage existing data sources (Slack, GitHub, Linear) to automatically generate organized, non-technical summaries of product changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to generate user-facing changelogs from our development data, so that I can communicate product updates to customers without manually translating technical details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects the changelog generation option THEN the system SHALL display a new changelog generation interface
2. WHEN a user specifies a date range for changelog generation THEN the system SHALL collect relevant data from Slack, GitHub, and Linear within that timeframe
3. WHEN the system processes the collected data THEN it SHALL identify changes that impact end users
4. WHEN generating the changelog THEN the system SHALL categorize changes into "New Features", "Improvements", and "Fixes"
5. WHEN presenting technical information THEN the system SHALL translate it into user-friendly language that avoids jargon

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer success manager, I want changelogs that explain the business value of updates, so that I can help customers understand how changes benefit their workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system identifies a change THEN it SHALL generate both "What changed" and "Why it matters" descriptions
2. WHEN describing performance improvements THEN the system SHALL focus on user benefits rather than technical implementation details
3. WHEN describing new features THEN the system SHALL explain the user value and use cases
4. WHEN describing bug fixes THEN the system SHALL explain the improved user experience
5. WHEN generating descriptions THEN the system SHALL use simple, accessible language appropriate for non-technical stakeholders

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a marketing team member, I want well-organized changelogs with clear categories, so that I can easily extract information for customer communications and product announcements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a changelog THEN the system SHALL organize changes into distinct categories (New Features, Improvements, Fixes)
2. WHEN multiple similar changes exist THEN the system SHALL group them logically under appropriate headings
3. WHEN presenting the changelog THEN the system SHALL prioritize changes by user impact and visibility
4. WHEN formatting the output THEN the system SHALL provide clean, readable formatting suitable for external communication
5. WHEN exporting changelogs THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (Markdown, HTML, plain text)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want the changelog generator to filter out internal-only changes, so that customer-facing communications only include relevant updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing GitHub commits THEN the system SHALL identify user-facing changes versus internal refactoring
2. WHEN analyzing Linear tickets THEN the system SHALL distinguish between customer-impacting features and internal improvements
3. WHEN reviewing Slack discussions THEN the system SHALL extract user-relevant insights while filtering out internal technical discussions
4. WHEN a change has no user impact THEN the system SHALL exclude it from the generated changelog
5. WHEN uncertain about user impact THEN the system SHALL flag items for manual review

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to customize and review generated changelogs before publication, so that I can ensure accuracy and appropriate messaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a changelog is generated THEN the system SHALL present it in an editable format
2. WHEN editing changelog content THEN the system SHALL allow modifications to descriptions and categorizations
3. WHEN reviewing entries THEN the system SHALL provide source references for each changelog item
4. WHEN finalizing a changelog THEN the system SHALL allow adding custom entries not derived from data sources
5. WHEN satisfied with the changelog THEN the system SHALL provide export options for distribution
