# Vector Store RAG Enhancement - Requirements

## Introduction

Enhance the retro insights generator with a vector store and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to overcome token limitations and provide richer historical context for team retrospectives.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Vector Store Integration

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want the system to store and index all historical team data so that retrospectives can draw insights from long-term patterns and trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN team data is collected THEN the system SHALL store it in a vector database with semantic embeddings
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL create embeddings for commits, issues, and messages with relevant metadata
3. WHEN data is indexed THEN the system SHALL preserve temporal relationships and cross-platform correlations
4. WHEN storing embeddings THEN the system SHALL include metadata for filtering (date ranges, team members, repositories, etc.)

### Requirement 2: Semantic Retrieval System

**User Story:** As a retrospective analyst, I want the system to intelligently retrieve relevant historical context so that current insights can be compared against past patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL perform semantic search to find similar historical situations
2. WHEN retrieving context THEN the system SHALL find relevant patterns from previous sprints/periods
3. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL support filtering by time periods, team members, and data types
4. WHEN retrieving data THEN the system SHALL rank results by relevance and recency

### Requirement 3: RAG-Enhanced Analysis

**User Story:** As a team member, I want retrospective insights to include historical context and trends so that I can understand if current patterns are improvements or regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing current data THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant historical context via RAG
2. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL compare current patterns to historical baselines
3. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL reference successful past solutions to similar problems
4. WHEN identifying issues THEN the system SHALL indicate if problems are recurring or new

### Requirement 4: Incremental Data Processing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the vector store to update incrementally so that new data is automatically indexed without reprocessing everything.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new data is collected THEN the system SHALL add only new items to the vector store
2. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL detect and skip already-indexed items
3. WHEN updating THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across related data points
4. WHEN indexing THEN the system SHALL handle data updates and deletions appropriately

### Requirement 5: Historical Trend Analysis

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to see how current team performance compares to historical trends so that I can identify long-term improvements or concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL identify trends over multiple time periods
2. WHEN analyzing patterns THEN the system SHALL compare current metrics to historical averages
3. WHEN detecting changes THEN the system SHALL highlight significant improvements or regressions
4. WHEN providing context THEN the system SHALL reference specific historical examples

### Requirement 6: Privacy and Data Management

**User Story:** As a data privacy officer, I want the vector store to maintain the same privacy protections as the current system while enabling historical analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL apply the same sanitization rules as current processing
2. WHEN creating embeddings THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive information in vector representations
3. WHEN retrieving data THEN the system SHALL respect privacy levels and access controls
4. WHEN managing data THEN the system SHALL support data retention policies and deletion requests

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the enhanced system to maintain fast response times even with large amounts of historical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing retrieval THEN the system SHALL return results within 2 seconds for typical queries
2. WHEN scaling data THEN the system SHALL handle months of team history without performance degradation
3. WHEN processing THEN the system SHALL use efficient indexing and caching strategies
4. WHEN querying THEN the system SHALL optimize vector searches for the most common use cases
