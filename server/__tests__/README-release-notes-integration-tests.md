- Multiple entry types (AI-generated and manual)
- Various export formats and options
- User interaction patterns and workflows
- Error scenarios and edge cases

## Test Execution

To run all release notes integration tests:
```bash
npm test -- --run release-notes-integration.test.js release-notes-ui-integration.test.js
```

To run specific test categories:
```bash
# Core integration tests
npm test -- --run release-notes-integration.test.js

# UI integration tests
npm test -- --run release-notes-ui-integration.test.js

# Specific test suites
npm test -- --run release-notes-integration.test.js -t "Export Functionality"
npm test -- --run release-notes-ui-integration.test.js -t "Manual Editing"
```

## Integration with Existing System

The integration tests are designed to:
- Work alongside existing retro generation tests
- Use the same testing infrastructure and patterns
- Maintain consistency with existing test data formats
- Integrate with the existing ExportService functionality

## Continuous Integration

These integration tests are designed to:
- Run in CI/CD pipelines without external dependencies
- Provide comprehensive coverage of release notes functionality
- Catch regressions in both backend and UI integration
- Validate all user-facing requirements and workflows

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the test suite:
